# WOD3: Rectangle Class with Outline

So far we have created a Circle, Square, and Rectangle class. Next we'll update your Rectangle class by adding support for an outline color.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<10 min" Av="10-20 min" Sd="20-30 min" DNF="31+ min" %}

## Instructions

1. Write down your start time on your notecard.
1. If you haven't been following along, download the [Shapes Project](Shapes_wod3.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Add a new field, `outlineColor`, to the `Rectangle` class.
2. Update the constructors to support the outline. You should have 3 constructors:
    * Default constructor (no parameters)
    * Constructor with 5 parameters (no `outlineColor`)
    * Constructor with 6 parameters (one for each field)
3. Add get & set methods for the outline color.
4. Update the `paint` method to draw the outline. 
4. Test your Rectangle changes in Picture.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting `Export > General > Archive File`. Name the file `RectangleOutline_uLogin.zip`.
4. Upload the file to the assignment page on canvas.
4. Write down your stop time on your notecard.
