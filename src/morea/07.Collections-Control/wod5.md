# WOD 5: Movie DB

To practice working with ArrayLists, we're going to create a simple movie DB.

## Instructions

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<15 min" Av="15-30 min" Sd="30-45 min" DNF="45+ min" %}

1. Write down your start time on your notecard.
1. Download [MovieDB.zip](MovieDB.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Rename the project to include your `uLogin`
1. Create a `MovieDB` class that: 
    * Stores a list of songs as an `ArrayList`, and initializes the list to be empty.
    * Has a method `addMovie` that adds a song to the `ArrayList`.
    * Has a `print` method that prints the entire movie list using a for each loop.
    * Has a `getOldestMovie` method that returns the `Movie` object with the oldest year.
    * Has a `main` method that adds 3 movies to the `MovieDB`, and prints them out by calling the `print` method.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting `Export > General > Archive File`. Name the file `MovieDB_uLogin.zip`.
4. Upload the file to the assignment page on canvas.
4. Write down your stop time on your notecard.
