# WOD2: Creating a Rectangle class

So far we have created a Circle & Square class. Next we'll create a Rectangle class.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<10 min" Av="10-20 min" Sd="20-30 min" DNF="30+ min" %}

## Instructions

1. Write down your start time on your notecard
1. If you haven't been following along in class, download the [Shapes Project](Shapes_phw2.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Right-click on your Shapes project and go to New > Class to create a `Rectangle` class. Go ahead and check the box for Eclipse to create a main method.
1. Add 5 fields to this class: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `color`. Integers recommended.
2. Add 2 constructors:
    * Default constructor (no parameters)
    * Constructor with 5 parameters (one for each field)
3. Add get & set methods for all the fields
<!--4. Add a `getArea()` and a `getPerimeter()` method & test them in main by creating a Rectangle variable, initializing it by calling one of the constructors, and printing out its value.-->
2. Test that your set & get width methods are working in main by creating a Rectangle variable, initializing it by calling one of the constructors, and printing out its value. Set the width to a different value, and print the new value by calling your get method.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting “Export > General > Archive File”. Name the file “Rectangle_uLogin.zip”.
4. Upload the file to the assignment page on canvas
4. Write down your stop time on your notecard
